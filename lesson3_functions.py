# copy and paste the below code 3 more times and print a different name
# a function is a group of code that needs to be called multipl times
# put the code in a function called printName so you don't have to keep typing the same code over and over
# call the function in place of where the duplicate code would normally be
# make sure to create the function before you call it
print('John')
now = datetime.datetime.now()
print ("Current date and time : ")

print('Bob')

print ("Current date and time : ")
print (now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))

# The duplicate code usually has one thing that needs to be different, in this case name
# a function handles this with arguments
# an argument is just variable that you are assigning for each function call
# add an argument to your function 'thename'
